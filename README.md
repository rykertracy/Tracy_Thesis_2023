# Tracy Thesis 2023
This repo contains the MATLAB codes used in the Texas Tech University thesis: Geophysical Investigation of the Moho Beneath New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.

## Original Workflow
Data downloaded from PyWeed was originally in SAC format. The first step was to translate from SAC to MAT through the "SACtoMATB_2023Z.m" program. "rdsac.m" and "SACTOOLB_2023Z.m" are depended on by the program, and I did not write them--the first came from Mathworks and the second from a previous Texas Tech student. 

After MAT files created, "eventsorter_RT_2023Z.m" and "stationsorter_RT_2023Z" will copy and group data into seismic events and recording stations.
