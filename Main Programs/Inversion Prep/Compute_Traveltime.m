% This program calculates the travel time for seismic ray paths based on geophysical data.

% Define the array 'p_arrival' using the pre-calculated arrival times for P-waves from clean signals (c_p_arrival).
p_arrival = c_p_arrival;

% Loop through each ray path to compute time picks and retrieve event and file times.
for i = 1:length(path)
    % Load seismic data from the current path file, which contains event details.
    load(path{i}, 'data')
    
    % Store the time pick (arrival time) for each path. 
    % 'c_dt' is a sample rate.
    time_pick(i) = p_arrival(i) * c_dt(i);
    
    % Store the event time of the seismic event.
    event_time(i, :) = data.evtime;
    
    % Store the start time of the seismic record (when the recording began).
    file_time(i, :) = data.begintime;
end

% Adjust milliseconds in event times for improved precision in calculations.
% Add fractional seconds (milliseconds) from the 6th column into the seconds column (5th).
event_time(:, 5) = event_time(:, 5) + (event_time(:, 6) ./ 1000);
% Remove the millisecond column after adjustment.
event_time(:, 6) = [];

% Calculate the initial travel time by subtracting the event time from the file time.
traveltime = file_time(:, 1:end) - event_time(:, 1:end);

for k = 1:length(traveltime)
    % Adjust for cases where thereâ€™s a carry-over in seconds or minutes.
