# Modeling
These programs were used to choose P-wave arrivals and engage in modeling with them.

## Programs 
CleanSignalSort_RT_2023Z.m - Displays clean signals and allows the user to click where the P wave arrives. Relies on external programs: firfilter and PPicker

plot_data_map_RT_2023Z.m - Should be run immediately after SACtoMAT. It gives an idea of the clusters of events and stations spatially. Created March 2, 2023.

Manual_P_Pick.m - Allows a user to click on the location of the P wave arrival on a wavelet and store the pick location.
